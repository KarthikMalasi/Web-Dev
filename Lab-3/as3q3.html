                <p>Launching a startup is exciting, but sustaining it is even more challenging. That 
                 is where things get tricky. In the chaos of building a team, developing a product,
                 and pitching to investors, one crucial milestone is often overlooked: achieving product-market fit.</p>
                 <p>In simple terms, product-market fit is when your product starts to sell itself. 
                 Customers not only use it but also love it, talk about it, and most importantly, keep coming back.
                 This moment marks the transition from building a product to building a business.</p>
                 <p>For early-stage startups, mastering this stage can mean the difference between 
                 explosive growth and running out of steam. Without product-market fit, marketing campaigns
                 fall flat, user acquisition is expensive, and churn erodes your efforts. With it, growth becomes organic,
                 retention strengthens, and your startup becomes investor-friendly.</p>

                <h2>What is Product-Market Fit?</h2>

                <p>Product-market fit means you have found a sweet spot where your product satisfies a strong market demand.
                 It is that moment when your users start coming back, telling others about your product, and you do not have
                  to push it down their throats with aggressive marketing.</p>

                 <h2>Why Product-Market Fit Matters</h2>

                 <p>Without a startup product-market fit, all efforts in sales, marketing,
                 and growth hacking might go to waste. It is the difference between struggling to 
                 find customers and your product gaining organic traction.</p>
